{\bfseries \hyperlink{namespaceJEGA}{J\+E\+GA} Version Release Changes}

{\bfseries v2.\+1}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Change of the algorithm progression to pass the initial population directly to the fitness assessor bypassing the variational operators.
\item Introduction of the Post Processor operator for filtering final solutions.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Creation of the Null\+Post\+Processor to serve as the null objects of post processors.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Addition of much source code documentation.
\item Addition of new \char`\"{}distance\char`\"{} niche pressure applicator.
\item Introduction of \char`\"{}region of space\char`\"{} concept and constructs for potential use in the future whereby algorithms can be confined to sub-\/regions of the design space.
\item Addition of new \char`\"{}double matrix\char`\"{} initializer that reads initial designs from a supplied matrix of values.
\item Multiple bug fixes.
\item Multiple improvements to the logging output.
\end{DoxyItemize}

{\bfseries v2.\+0}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Namespace Updates\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Introduction of \hyperlink{namespaceJEGA}{J\+E\+GA} namespace.
\item namespace Utilities became namespace \hyperlink{namespaceJEGA_1_1Utilities}{J\+E\+G\+A\+::\+Utilities}.
\item namespace Genetic\+Algorithms became namespace \hyperlink{namespaceJEGA_1_1Algorithms}{J\+E\+G\+A\+::\+Algorithms}.
\item Introduction of namespace \hyperlink{namespaceJEGA_1_1FrontEnd}{J\+E\+G\+A\+::\+Front\+End}
\item Introduction of namespace \hyperlink{namespaceJEGA_1_1Logging}{J\+E\+G\+A\+::\+Logging} to house the \hyperlink{namespaceJEGA}{J\+E\+GA} specific front end to the eddy logging project.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Introduction of eddy projects including\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Threads project for thread safety (this is not used in Dakota but is available when using \hyperlink{namespaceJEGA}{J\+E\+GA} independently of Dakota).
\item Logging project for all reporting to the user during execution with the exception of writing data files.
\item Utilities project for various data structures, utility classes, and data types such as fixed size integers.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Addition of many logging points where information can now be presented to the user.
\item Introduction of new class of operators for niche pressure.
\item Introduction of radial niche pressure applicator.
\item Modification of Domination\+Count\+Selector into Domination\+Count\+Fitness\+Assessor for use with various selectors.
\item Introduction of Below\+Limit\+Selector for selecting designs within a limiting value of fitness.
\item Creation of Front End project to ease the use of \hyperlink{namespaceJEGA}{J\+E\+GA} as a third party library in other applications.
\item Movement of fitness tracker convergers out of the S\+O\+GA directory into the top level GA directory for shared use.
\item Introduction of M\+O\+GA convergence operator.
\item Overhaul of core data structures including elimination of P\+O\+D\+Deque, H\+Sort\+Deque, etc. in favor of S\+TL multiset class with specialized predicates. The new implementation is safer, faster, more robust, and more portable.
\item Overhaul of Statistician classes for increased flexibility with data structures.
\item Intrduction of Parameter\+Database interface and associated Basic Impl to avoid the need for \char`\"{}two-\/way\char`\"{} dependencies when using \hyperlink{namespaceJEGA}{J\+E\+GA} as a third party library.
\item Introduction of the Parameter\+Extractor class to ease the use of obtaining values from Parameter\+Database class objects.
\item Elimination of \char`\"{}\+Plug-\/in\char`\"{} design style for Designs and Design Groups in favor of returning sepecialized data structures with relevant information. This results in short-\/lived value storage which is safer than attempting to keep such information up-\/to-\/date during the course of an algorithm especially when it is usually only needed immediately after it is calculated.
\item Introduction of data structures to support the previous bullet.
\item Separation of Design\+Target into pure interface and associated Basic Impl.
\item Separation of Design\+::\+Get\+Variable method into Design\+::\+Get\+Variable\+Value and Design\+::\+Get\+Variable\+Rep to ease retrieval of variable values in the desired form.
\item Introduction of Design\+File\+Reader class to aid in retrieving designs from files. Currently only flat files are supported.
\item Addition of much code documentation.
\item Overhauled J\+E\+G\+A\+Optimizer class to make use of \hyperlink{namespaceJEGA}{J\+E\+GA} front end project.
\item Fixed bug in multi-\/point parameterized crossover routine whereby it was using the bitwise or operator where it should have been using the xor.
\item Overhauled multi-\/point crossover routine for correct operation.
\item Numerous other bug fixes.
\item Changed all convergers to respect max gens and max evals.
\item Change to the way constraints are handled by the multi-\/objective statistician. Now tracks violations to get idea of how much violation is \char`\"{}a lot\char`\"{} and compares designs based on that.
