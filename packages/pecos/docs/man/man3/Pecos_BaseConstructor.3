.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
Dummy struct for overloading letter-envelope constructors\&. 

\fBBaseConstructor\fP is used to overload the constructor for the base class portion of letter objects\&. It avoids infinite recursion (Coplien p\&.139) in the letter-envelope idiom by preventing the letter from instantiating another envelope\&. Putting this struct here avoids circular dependencies\&.
