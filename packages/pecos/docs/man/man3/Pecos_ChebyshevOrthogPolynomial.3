.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
Derived orthogonal polynomial class for Chebyshev polynomials\&. 

The \fBChebyshevOrthogPolynomial\fP class evaluates a univariate Chebyshev polynomial of the first kind (T_n(x)) of a particular order\&. These polynomials are orthogonal with respect to the weight function 1/sqrt(1-x^2) when integrated over the support range of [-1,+1]\&. It enables (mixed) multidimensional orthogonal polynomial basis functions within \fBOrthogPolyApproximation\fP\&. Chebyshev polynomials are a special case of the more general Jacobi polynomials (implemented separately)\&.
